# open-dudu-cook-book2

An electron-vue project that clones an abandonware called DuduCookBook.

## What is DuduCookBook

[Dudusoft](http://www.dudusoft.com/)(嘟嘟軟件, [Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20090417062143/http://www.dudusoft.com/)) was a software company that developed a cookbook software called DuduCookBook(嘟嘟美食菜谱).

One day, I found DuduCookBook in my computer, and later found that its website has been closed for almost ten years. However, there's a thing that amused me: that the software uses HTML technology to render contents. Also, I dumped some XML files from it. Then I thought: "How about rendering and modify them by modern technology?"

So, I develop the app. However, [the first version](https://github.com/iigmir/open-dudu-cook-book) was using ["MASSIVELY OUTDATED"](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue/issues/1026) software that made the whole development experience a mess. Therefore, I export my old files to the current project.
